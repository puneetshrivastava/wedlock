                         In the Indian ethos of matchmaking, marriage is a sacred bond not just between two individuals, but also an alliance of two families that come together to share rituals, customs, festivities, duties and responsibilities. In a country with such a vast array of cultures and religions including Hindus, Punjabis, Aggarwals, Jains, Baniyas, Sikhs, Brahmins, Jains, Marwaris, Rajputs, Muslims, Christians and various other castes, a profound knowledge of their customs and traditions is paramount for carrying out the requisite partner search.
